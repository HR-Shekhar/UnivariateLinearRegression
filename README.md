# UnivariateLinearRegression
This is my first model which i trained with two different approaches.
First approach is the mathematical approach in which I wrote all the Cost funtion, Gradient and Gradient Descent to train my model.
And then I went with the regular approach of using the scikit-learn library.
I took the data from Kaggle, cleaned it and prepared it to use it for my Univariate Linear Regression.
