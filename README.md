# UnivariateLinearRegression
This is my first model which i trained with two different approaches.
First approach is the mathematical approach in which I wrote all the Cost funtion, Gradient and Gradient Descent to train my model.
And then I went with the regular approach of using the scikit-learn library.
I took the data from Kaggle, cleaned it and prepared it to use it for my Univariate Linear Regression.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Predict **CO2 Emissions (g/km)** based on **Engine Size (L)** using a univariate linear regression model.

## 🛠️ Features

- Implemented Linear Regression from scratch
- Used Gradient Descent for optimization
- Visualized the model using Matplotlib
- Evaluated the model using R² Score

## 📦 Dataset

- Dataset: [CO2 Emissions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/c/2692038)
- Features: `Engine Size (L)`  
- Target: `CO2 Emissions (g/km)`  

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HR-Shekhar/UnivariateLinearRegression.git
    cd UnivariateLinearRegression
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
    ```

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

1. Open and run the `UnivariateLinearRegression.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any IDE like Visual Studio Code.

2. Modify `lambda_`, `learning_rate`, and `iterations` as needed.

3. Visualize the results using the plots.

## 📈 Evaluation

- **R² Score:** `0.72` *(example)*  
- **Mean Squared Error:** `###`
